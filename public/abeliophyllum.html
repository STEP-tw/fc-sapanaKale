		Abelialeaf)</b> is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae.

It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having white, not yellow, flowers.<br><br>
		It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm wide, pubescent both above and below.

The fruit is a round, winged samara 2 to 3 cm diameter.<br><br> 
		It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America.<br><br>
